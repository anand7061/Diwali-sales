# Diwali Sales Analysis 📈
📝 Overview
This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of sales data from an e-commerce platform during the Diwali festival season. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights and trends related to customer demographics, popular product categories, and regional sales performance. By analyzing this data, we can better understand customer behavior and identify key drivers of sales during this festive period.

The entire analysis is documented in a Jupyter Notebook (Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb), which includes data cleaning, processing, visualization, and a summary of the findings.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The primary objective of this analysis is to answer key business questions that can help stakeholders make data-driven decisions for future sales strategies. The key questions addressed are:

What is the gender distribution of buyers, and which gender has higher purchasing power?

Which age group contributes the most to sales?

Which states are the top contributors to sales?

What is the marital status of the highest-spending customers?

Which occupations are most represented among the buyers?

What are the top-selling product categories?

What is the relationship between customer age, gender, and their purchasing behavior?

## 💡 Key Insights & Findings
Based on the analysis, the following key insights were derived:

Gender Dynamics: Women are the primary shoppers, accounting for approximately 65% of total sales and exhibiting a higher purchasing power than men.

Top Age Group: The age group of 26-35 years is the most significant contributor to sales, indicating that young professionals are the key demographic.

Regional Hotspots: The top 3 states by sales are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. Marketing efforts could be concentrated in these regions.

Marital Status Impact: Married individuals, particularly women, constitute the largest segment of buyers, suggesting a trend of family-oriented and gift purchasing.

Top Product Categories: The most popular product categories are Food, Clothing & Apparel, and Electronics & Gadgets.

High-Value Occupations: Customers in the IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors are among the top spenders.

## 📊 Visualizations
The analysis is supported by a variety of visualizations created using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including:

Bar Charts: To compare sales across different categories like gender, age groups, states, and product categories.

Count Plots: To show the distribution of categorical data like marital status and occupations.

Heatmaps: To visualize correlations between different numerical attributes (if applicable).

Pie Charts: To represent the proportion of sales from different zones or customer demographics.
